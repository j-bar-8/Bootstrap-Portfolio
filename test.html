                    <p>Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh! 
                        You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett. Yes, my lord. Make ready 
                        to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets 
                        off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett. Thank you, Lord Vader.</p>

                    <p>Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. 
                        One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him!
                         I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, 
                         but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground 
                         staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of 
                         Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.</p>
                        
                    <p>Luke! You must complete the training. I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. 
                        I've got to help them. You must not go! But Han and Leia will die if I don't. You don't know that. 
                        Even Yoda cannot see their fate. But I can help them! I feel the Force! But you cannot control it. 
                        This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force. Yes, yes. 
                        To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave! But I've learned so much since then. 
                        Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word. It is you and your 
                        abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer. And that is why I have to go. 
                        Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader. You won't. Stopped they must be. 
                        On this depends.</p>
